# AgonLight2
Fun for Nostalgia.

So I see people building these old retro 8 bit computers, and then I see the AgonLight2.
After being a proud Sinclair ZX81 and Timex Sinclair 2068 owner how could I pass up a computer that is 50 times faster,
and all the RAM you could want (in an eight bit computer).

So I got one, I had to place a second order to get a keyboard that would work with it.
In the meantime, I had an old Timex Sinclair 2068 that I had picked from Ebay about 5 years ago, so I ordered some stuff for that as well.
While I was waiting for the keyboard to come in, I typed in "Four In a Row" from 101 Basic Computer Games on the Sinclair.
I made some light changes, debugged a little bit and then it was working...very slowly...but working.
Then the keyboard comes, and I translate it into BBC basic, debug, and renumber.
So I looked up David Ahl, and he put all his publications into the public domain. Thank you David!
So now I can share the code with others so they don't have to type as much.
So I can attach the file, which is not a text file, but a BBC Basic file.
As I complete more games, (I am only interested in about 3) I will put them here as I get time.
By the way, the computer beats me every time.  But my son won on the first try.
