# AgonLight2
Fun for Nostalgia.

# Part 1

So I see people building these old retro 8 bit computers, and then I see the AgonLight2.
After being a proud Sinclair ZX81 and Timex Sinclair 2068 owner how could I pass up a computer that is 50 times faster,
and all the RAM you could want (in an eight bit computer).

So I got one, I had to place a second order to get a keyboard that would work with it.
In the meantime, I had an old Timex Sinclair 2068 that I had picked from Ebay about 5 years ago, so I ordered some stuff for that as well.
While I was waiting for the keyboard to come in, I typed in "Four In a Row" from 101 Basic Computer Games on the Sinclair.
I made some light changes, debugged a little bit and then it was working...very slowly...but working.
Then the keyboard comes, and I translate it into BBC basic, debug, and renumber.
So I looked up David Ahl, and he put all his publications into the public domain. Thank you David!
So now I can share the code with others so they don't have to type as much.
So I can attach the file, which is not a text file, but a BBC Basic file.
As I complete more games, (I am only interested in about 3) I will put them here as I get time.
By the way, the computer beats me every time.  But my son won on the first try.

# Part 2

I typed in a program I called Lunar_Type_1.bbc. This is a Lunar Lander text based game. I typed the game from the same book, and made a few changes.
I renumbered the program (I love that for basic), and added a few comments.  To the people that were not around in the 1980's the reason there were very few comments in programs back then, and generally the code was very dense, and hense hard to read, is because RAM was so limited back then.  We have the luxury today to add a few comments and some improvements because the memory pressure in the AgonLight2 is practically nonexistant.  Or to word it another way, there is more RAM than you need for these small programs.  The reason for the strange name Lunar_Type_1.bbc is because there are 2 more programs that do almost the same thing but in a different way, and I plan to eventually do those too.

# Conclusion

Anyone can freely take the BBC files and run them on the AgonLight2.
Unfortunately the files are not text, so you can't just read the files without loading them on the AgonLight2.
I encourage anyone with an AgonLight2 to take these files and use them to your hearts content.
I also want to grab other peoples public AgonLight2 bbc files and copy them here as well.
Other programs I plan on making are the 2 other Lunar Lander Programs and Super Star Trek.
I don't really have plans for anything else, but who knows...
